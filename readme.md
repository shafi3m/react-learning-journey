# ⚛️ React Mini Projects – Learning by Building

Welcome to my **React Learning Repository**!  
This repo contains a series of hands-on mini projects that I've built to **practice and master React fundamentals**.

Each folder represents a standalone project that focuses on one or more key React concepts.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

This repository is helping me get hands-on with:

- ✅ React fundamentals: Components, JSX, Props, State
- ✅ React Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useCallback`
- ✅ Component composition and reusability
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling
- ✅ Building real-world mini tools and UIs

## 📌 How to Run Any Project

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-mini-projects.git
cd react-mini-projects
```

2. Navigate into any project folder:

```bash
cd 04_password-generator
```

3. Install dependencies and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Note: These projects use **Vite** for fast setup and development.

## 🚀 Future Plans
